1.Computers process in chunks of n-bits
2.Computers access memory with large latency
  a.Sequential is much faster
  b.Burst mode DDR x8
  c.2 banks of memory
3. Computers can't go faster with faster clock speed(why?)
  a.Heat
4. Instead, what can we do?
  a. design better instruction
  b. video encoder
  c. CRC
  d. compression
  e. encryption
  f. Gouraud Shading
5. Other ways to speed up compting
  a. wider word width
  b. Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)
  c. Vectorization
6. Future
  a. Optical computing
    1. Cheap, low power laser/photodetector
    2. optical transistor
  b. quantum computers 
    qbits can try 2^n combinations in one 
7. review
  integer math
  signed/unsigned 2s complement 
  -1 = 1111111111111111111111111111111
  uint16_t a = -1; // 1111111111111111
  // 65535

  floating point math
  0.5
  100.5
  .2 = 1/5 not a nice fraction
  infinity and NAN
  double a = (1.0 / 0); = infinity
  double b = -1.0 / 0.0; = -infinity
  double c = 5 / a; = 0
  double d = 3 / b; = -0
  double e = a + b = NAN
  double f = 0.0 / 0/0  = NAN
  sin(infinity) = NAN

  Hardware
  1.design a circuit to turn on/off
  2. loop up spec sheet find relevant limitations

  sub %rcx, %rdx

  cmp %rcx, %rdx #compute rdx-rcx
