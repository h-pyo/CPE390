Part 3:
How much faster is CRC using intrinsics vs. regular C++?
    CRC is about two times faster

Why is the CRC using the intrinsics more efficient than the crc code written in straight C++?
    When CRC uses intrinsic, it is more efficient than the crc code written in straight c++ since it optimizes the assembly,
    which is more efficient than the straight C++ code.

What is an Intel Intrinsic?
    Intel Intrinsic has functions that are coded from assembly that let the user have C++ function calls and vairables when using assembly code.

What is the disadvantage of embedding an intrinsic in your code?
    The disadvantage is that it can cause higher latencies in the code when embedding an intrinsic into your code.
    Also, embedding an intrinsic into your code in usually only possible with newer computers.

We did not have time to benchmark the dov vs. the dov8 code. But the dov8 is optimized by precomputing the key into 64-bit values. Estimate how much more efficient the dov8 code might be on processing a large (1GB) block of memory.
    I think that dov8 should be about 8 times faster than dov. The reason for this is that dov8 encrypts 8 bytes at a time while dov does 1 byte at a time.
